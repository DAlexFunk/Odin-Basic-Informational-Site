# Odin-Basic-Informational-Site
The Basic Informational Site project from The Odin Project

## About
This is the basic information site from The Odin Project. This project is meant to practice using Node as a simple server for a website. Because of this, the layout of the pages is not the focus and is thus as basic as possible.

## Use
* Start the server by running script.js.
* Visit localhost:8080 to see the site.
* The pages are /, /about, and /contact-me.
* A 404 page is shown if the url is not one of the 3 above.

## Credits
* [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) for providing the project guidelines and teaching the skills necessary.
